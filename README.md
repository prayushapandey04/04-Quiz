# 04-Quiz

This is a coding quiz which tests the user content over simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This is a 5 question coding quiz website which will test your knowledge on JavaScript. This assignment was given to me blank and I created all the necessary files for the quiz. By creating the HTML and CSS, I have styled the website and added the content to the page. By using JavaScript, I have been able to add functionality to the page. The quiz is a timed quiz and it has a timer which counts down from 300 seconds (5 minutes) to 0. The user is asked 5 questions and at the end they get a score.

## Usage 

The user will press the "Begin Quiz" button and the timer starts counting down from 300 seconds. The user will get asked the first question and will have 3 answer choices. After the user presses their answer, they get automatic feedback on whether or not they got the question right. Then, they are immediately prompted to the next question. After the user finishes the quiz, they will get an alert message which will say the quiz has been submitted and they will get their score.
